Howdy.
I doubt I will ever stop feeling like my career is just starting, but it has already been quite fortuitous.
The foundation for this good fortune has been the help and mentoring I have received from many colleagues, friends and strangers.
Now, I would like to be your colleague, friend and/or stranger.

I can speak best to things I have experience and interest in, somethings you might consider asking me about:

* **Exercise**: I collect resources and experiment to improve my fitness.
* **Game Design**: I am an avid collector and player of board/card games.
* **Mentoring**: I do my best to share my good fortune.
* **Open Source**: I have contribute to and maintain several large established projects.
* **Quantified Self**: I have explored a lot of the ecosystem and have some favorites.
* **Ruby**: I do lots of programming and Ruby is my drug of choice.
* **Speaking**: I have spoken at a few technical conferences.
* **User Experience**: I try to bring a UX perspective to most everything I do.

If you would like to get things going just send me an email at <a href="mailto:geemus+mentoring@gmail.com">geemus+mentoring@geemus.com</a> and don't forget to include some details about yourself. Some suggestions:

* Tell me a little about yourself.
* What have you accomplished so far and what are your goals?
* What do you hope to gain through our interactions?
* What is the best thing you read, watched or listened to lately?
